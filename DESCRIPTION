Title: Create Waterfall Charts using 'ggplot2' Simply
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Hugh Parsonage
Maintainer: Hugh Parsonage <hugh.parsonage+waterfall@gmail.com>
Description: A not uncommon task for quants is to create 'waterfall charts'. There seems to be no simple way to do this in 'ggplot2' currently. This package contains a single function (waterfall) that simply draws a waterfall chart in a 'ggplot2' object. Some flexibility is provided, though often the object created will need to be modified through a theme.
